# Rick & Morty API

This tiny application has been developed as a livecoding project with classroom #98, using it as an example of a simple Vue 3 and Vite application that fetches a list of Rick & Morty characters via the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

Additionally, we also implemented a trivial API name search via input, to test our capabilities with both props and $emit functionalities.
